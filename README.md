# AdminDash
This was a tutorial by the great Ed Roh, through the guidance this admin dashboard was created and will continue to update over time. The tutorial can be found on YouTube however this specific repository has the kinks worked out including calendar, styling with sx, and more.

Process:
- Using React
- Material UI
- Nivo Charts
- Formik
- Yup
- Fullcalendar.io
- Data Grid
- Dark Mode & Light Mode
- Form validation

Challenges:
- This was my first React project: Zero knowledge of React which resulted in taking over 6 hours to create this project. I was determined to complete it by end of day and I was successful (end time 9:30pm MST)
- In addition to being new to React it was challenging to move my current education aside and humble myself to learn something new. For example adding CSS to specific objects was irksome but after some research I was able to learn more extensive skills in CSS that can be applied to other projects
- Installing the correct libraries sounds easy enough especilly when following a tutorial. The thing is the tutorial was broken into chunks and missing those specific steps. I was able to pause the video and research useful libraries, in the end I enjoyed the humility and laughter once finding the right library.
